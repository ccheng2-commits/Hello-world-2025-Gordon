## Week 3
I created a game based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors, but with some variations.
At first, it’s a single-round win; then it changes to best of three.
Later, players must win consecutively before they can proceed to a flip coin stage.

# Week 4-6
Keep rewinding 

## Week 7For this exercise, I attempted to build a simple Snake Game using pygame.
I started by installing the library, then learned how to control movements through keyboard inputs.
The main mechanic is that when the snake “eats” food, it grows longer.
Finally, I used pygame’s drawing functions to render blocks on the screen.
